There might be multiple different analytical lenses we could take on communities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>By Social Organization: studying how people are connected through kinship ties, marriage patterns, and all forms of social relationships. This analysis helps identify different social groups within the community, such as families or clans and their roles or hierarchies determine interactions</p> </li> <li> <p>By Economics: how people obtain and distribute resources, the division of labor, and how economic activity is organized. This analysis can involve studying subsistence strategies and economic exchange systems like reciprocity, vs market exchange.</p> </li> <li> <p>By Practices and Beliefs: examining religion, rituals, customs, language, art, and other cultural expressions. Cultural aspects tend to point out the community's shared meanings, identities, and worldview.</p> </li> <li> <p>By Political Systems: analyzing power relations, decision-making, and governance. We might look at the role of leaders, conflict, and other ways communities interact with external forces</p> </li> <li> <p>By Environmental Factors: this might include studying settlement patterns, land use, resource management, and the impact of environmental factors on social and cultural practices.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To investigate on any of these axes, we usually use participant observation, interviews, and look through documents.</p>"},{"location":"Bibliography/","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>This page is effectively a link farm for now of different ideas and publishers in this space that will be referenced.</p> <ul> <li>Geeks, Mops, and Sociopaths by David Chapman</li> <li>Microsolidarity, Richard D.

The San Francisco Hash House Harriers who bill themselves as a \"drinking club with a running problem\" lies at the intersection of a place (San Francisco) and two activities: drinking &amp; running.  It is similarly no problem to imagine a \"Democrats for Jesus\" group, or an New York City LGBTQ+ Accountant's organization.</p> <p>Communities are fundamentally organic themselves, so unsurprisingly they can form organically, through spontaneous interactions and shared connections. They are also frequently created intentionally by organizations seeking to bring people together.  No matter how they form, they provide a way for people to connect and support one another.</p>"},{"location":"Obsidian/","title":"Obsidian","text":"<p>Obsidian is a note-taking tool that is used to write this repository.</p>"},{"location":"What%20is%20Community/","title":"What is Community","text":"<p>Communities are simply groups of individuals who share interests, values, or goals and interact with one another.  Put quite simply: it is the result of groups of people participating in voluntary association.  There is little else that constrains what a community can be. While they can be defined by location, identity, or purpose, they do not have to meet any other criteria to be a community other than voluntary participation on the part of their members.</p> <p>Communities are everywhere though, because they provide a sense of belonging, support, and connection. They are not an add-on to the experience of being a human being, but core to it, and something that homo sapiens have done naturally since we evolved.</p> <p>It might have pleased the great Creator to have made man independent of all other beings; but as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life.</p> <p>Communities are an essential part of human social organization. They create cohesion, cooperation, mutual support, and identity among their members, as we will see.</p>"}]}

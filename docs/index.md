# Community

This will be an evolving set of notes about community.

1. [[What is Community]]?
2. [[How do Communities Form]]?
3. [[Anthropology]] and how we analyze communities

This work contains a list of references, a sort of digital [[Bibliography]].  The [[Braindump and TODO]] article is a dumping ground for as-yet unintegrated components and ideas.
